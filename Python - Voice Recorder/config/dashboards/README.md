# Built-in Dashboards

This folder contains built-in dashboard JSON files that the application loads by default.

To add a new dashboard, create a new JSON file following the informal schema in `docs/dashboard/dashboard_config_schema.md` and drop it into this folder. Use the `id` field to give it a stable name.
