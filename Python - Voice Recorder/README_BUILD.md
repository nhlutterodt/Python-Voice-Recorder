## Launch from source (developer-friendly)

Follow these precise steps when running from source (PowerShell examples). Incorrect working directory or PYTHONPATH is the most common cause of import failures.

1. Prepare your environment (one-time):

```powershell
# From repository root
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\Python - Voice Recorder\scripts\setup_local_env.ps1"
```

1. Recommended developer launch (uses the project's launcher which handles PYTHONPATH):

```powershell
Set-Location "<repo-root>\Python - Voice Recorder"
.\Launch_VoiceRecorderPro.ps1 -Dev
```

1. Manual launch (if you need to run the main script directly):

```powershell
Set-Location "<repo-root>\Python - Voice Recorder"
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."
"<repo-root>\venv\Scripts\python.exe" src\enhanced_main.py
```

- Notes and common gotchas:

- The folder name includes a space: `Python - Voice Recorder`. Always run from that directory when launching manually.
- If imports fail, confirm `PYTHONPATH` is set to `.` and you are using the venv Python from the repository root (`venv\Scripts\python.exe`).
- To run in cmd.exe, replace PowerShell variable syntax with `set PYTHONPATH=.` and run the venv python executable directly.

## System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Microphone (for recording)
- Internet connection (for cloud features)

## Support
