# Custom markers used to classify tests. Use markers to select or skip slow
# / integration / GUI tests in CI and local runs.
markers =
    unit: quick unit tests (fast, no external resources)
    integration: integration tests requiring external resources (DB, cloud)
    gui: GUI tests (may require headless/Xvfb or offscreen Qt platform)
    slow: long-running tests
