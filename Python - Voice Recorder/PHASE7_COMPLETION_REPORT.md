## 7. MIGRATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPERS

### 7.1 Using the New Utilities

#### BaseWorkerThread Usage:
```python
from voice_recorder.utilities import BaseWorkerThread

class MyWorkerThread(BaseWorkerThread):
    def run(self):
        try:
            self.emit_progress("Starting work...")
            # Do work here
            self.emit_finished({"result": "success"})
        except Exception as e:
            self.emit_error(str(e))
```

#### AudioFileSelector Usage:
```python
from voice_recorder.utilities import AudioFileSelector

# Select single file(s)
files = AudioFileSelector.select_audio_files(parent_widget, "initial/dir")

# Select directory and scan for files
files = AudioFileSelector.select_audio_directory(parent_widget, "initial/dir")

# Populate UI list widget
AudioFileSelector.populate_list_widget(my_list_widget, files)

# Get unique files
unique_files = AudioFileSelector.get_unique_files(files)
```

#### get_logger Usage:
```python
from voice_recorder.utilities import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Application message")
logger.error("Error message")
```

### 7.2 Migration Checklist

For adding new worker threads:
- [ ] Inherit from BaseWorkerThread
- [ ] Implement run() method
- [ ] Use emit_progress() for updates
- [ ] Use emit_error() for exceptions
- [ ] Use emit_finished() for results
- [ ] Connect signals in parent class
- [ ] Test signal emission
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility
