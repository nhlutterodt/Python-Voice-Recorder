"""Progress reporting and tracking utilities.

Reserved for future progress UI helpers and reporting utilities.

Currently, progress tracking is handled by:

- BatchProcessorThread.emit_progress() - for batch operations
- performance_monitor.measure_operation() - for performance tracking

This module will expand to include:
- ProgressDialog helpers
- Progress bar management
- Real-time progress reporting to UI
