# Day 4 — Dashboard & Metrics: Completion Report

Date: 2025-10-18

Authors: Implementation agent (pair-programming)

## Summary
This document describes the Day 4 deliverable: a config-driven dashboard system, metrics aggregator, and baseline comparison engine added to the project. It explains design choices, how to enable and use the dashboard, where files live, and how to extend and test the feature.

What changed
- Added a metrics aggregator that collects counters/gauges/histograms and stores samples in SQLite.
- Added a baseline manager that computes baselines and detects deviations/alerts.
- Added a widget-based, config-driven dashboard system under `core/dashboard/` with renderers (Text/JSON/Markdown).
- Added built-in dashboard configs under `config/dashboards/` and unit tests that cover the new functionality.

Key design decisions
- Dashboard is config-driven (JSON files in `config/dashboards/`) to avoid hardcoding dashboards.
- Widgets are pluggable and described by a compact JSON schema so new widgets or dashboards can be added without code changes.
- Access to dashboards is gated: dashboards are hidden by default and require explicit enablement via environment variable `VRP_ADMIN_MODE` or by editing the config key `dashboard.enabled` (see Access Control doc).
- CLI-first approach: a Text renderer and convenience functions exist to render dashboards from scripts and tests; GUI integration is a future step.

Files changed / added (high-level)
- core/metrics_aggregator.py — metric ingestion and query API (record_counter, record_gauge, record_histogram, record_metric, query_metrics)
- core/metrics_baseline.py — baseline calculation and deviation/alert detection
- core/dashboard/ (new package) — widget base, concrete widgets, renderers, access control, and dashboard engine
- config/dashboards/*.json — built-in dashboard configurations (overview, performance, alerts)
- tests/test_dashboard.py — unit tests for widgets, renderers, dashboards, and access control
- docs/ (new) — documentation pages for dashboard features and how to enable/use them

How to enable (developer / admin)
1. Recommended (temporary/testing): set the environment variable in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:VRP_ADMIN_MODE = "1"
python -c "from core.dashboard.dashboard import render_dashboard; print(render_dashboard('overview', renderer='text'))"
```

2. Persistent (edit config): open the application's configuration and set `dashboard.enabled = true` in the appropriate settings file (note: confirm exact settings location in your deployment).

Security notes
- The dashboard contains operational metrics. Keep dashboards disabled on machines where exposing this data is undesirable.
- The current gating mechanism is conservative and appropriate for a single-user desktop application. For multi-user or remotely-accessible deployments, integrate the dashboard access check with a proper authentication/authorization system.

Testing & verification
- Unit tests for Day 4 live under `tests/` and were executed locally:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Owner\Voice Recorder\Python-Voice-Recorder\Python - Voice Recorder"
python -m pytest tests/test_metrics_aggregator.py tests/test_metrics_baseline.py tests/test_dashboard.py -q
```

- Expected outcome: all Day-4 tests pass (green). If examples in this document are copied, ensure `VRP_ADMIN_MODE` is set.

Next steps (short)
- Phase B: Expand module-level documentation (widget reference, renderer examples), add a small CLI wrapper and integrate a GUI toggle with a confirmation dialog.
- Consider adding an `mkdocs` site later for browsable documentation.

## CLI

A small CLI wrapper was included at `scripts/dashboard_cli.py`. See `docs/CLI.md` for usage examples and exit codes.

See `docs/dashboard/` for detailed docs: access control, widget reference, renderer reference, and config schema.
