## üìû SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Issues Occur:

**Pre-Deployment:**
1. Review test output: Look for specific test failures
2. Check imports: Verify all modules can be imported
3. Run locally: Execute test suite locally first

**Post-Deployment:**
1. Check logs: Review application and error logs
2. Run tests: Re-run test suite in production environment
3. Monitor performance: Watch CPU, memory, response times

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>  # Revert Phase 7 changes
git push origin main      # Push to production
```
