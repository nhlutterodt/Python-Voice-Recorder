git add CHANGELOG.md Python\ -\ Voice\ Recorder/pyproject.toml
git commit -m "chore: Prepare v2.1.0 release

- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v2.1.0 release notes
- Bumped version to 2.1.0 in pyproject.toml"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Create Release Tag

```bash
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0 - CI/CD Infrastructure Complete"
git push origin v2.1.0
```

### Step 5: Monitor Release Workflow

1. Watch workflow: https://github.com/nhlutterodt/Python-Voice-Recorder/actions
2. Verify all steps succeed:
   - âœ… Changelog extraction
   - âœ… Build wheel and sdist
   - âœ… Create draft release
   - âœ… Upload wheel
   - âœ… Upload sdist
   - âœ… Upload Windows exe

### Step 6: Review Draft Release

2. Review draft release v2.1.0
3. Verify:
   - âœ… Release notes from CHANGELOG.md
   - âœ… All 3 artifacts attached
   - âœ… File sizes match expectations

### Step 7: Publish Release

1. Click "Publish release" button
2. Verify release is public
3. Test download links

### Step 8: Post-Release Tasks

1. Announce release (if applicable)
2. Update roadmap completion status
3. Create PHASE1_COMPLETE.md document
4. Plan next phase (Tasks #19-23)

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after release:

### Option 1: Delete Release
```bash
gh release delete v2.1.0 --yes
git tag -d v2.1.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.1.0
```

### Option 2: Create Hotfix (v2.1.1)
1. Fix issue on main branch
2. Create v2.1.1 tag
3. Let release workflow handle it
